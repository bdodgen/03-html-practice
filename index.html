    <h4>How do I see the differences between HTML and CSS?</h4>

   <ol>
      <li>What is the difference between the usage of <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>?</li>
      <p><em>HTML is used for the content of a page, and CSS is used for styling the content.</em></p>
  
      <li>What is the newest version of <strong>HTML</strong>?</li>
      <p><em>HTML5</em></p>
  
      <li>What are the top five most used HTML5 elements? If not sure, make a guess.</li>
      <p>
        <ul><em>
          <li>div</li>
          <li>li</li>
          <li>a</li>
          <li>p</li>
          <li>img</li>
        </em></ul>
      </p>

      <p><em>

      </p></em>

      <li>What is the difference between semantic and non-semantic elements?</li>
      <p><em>Semantic elements make sense to the average English-speaking human. They describe what they contain (like header, footer, section, etc.), and non-semantic elements (like div) don't.</em></p>
  
      <li>Why do we prefer using <strong>semantic elements</strong>?</li>
      <p><em>Because it's better to write code for humans first since we're the ones maintaining it. </em></p>
  
      <li>Do all <strong>browsers support</strong> all of the newest HTML / CSS elements?</li>
      <p><em>no</em></p>
  
      <li>Test the following elements on Can I Use: svg, nav, code, form, datalist. Which browser version supports them and which do not?</li>
      <p><em><ul>
        <li>svg has full support on everything except IE, where it has partial support</li>
        <li>nav is fully supported</li>
        <li>code is fully supported</li>
        <li>form is supported on everything except IE</li>
        <li>datalist has full support on most browsers, except only partial support for IE and Firefox</li>
      </ul> </em></p>
